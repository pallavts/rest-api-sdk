# Get Log Events

Note: This endpoint is applicable only for SAAS deployments.

The ThoughtSpot log streaming service API allows you to programmatically get a security audit event log from the ThoughtSpot system.

To use this API, make sure you have admin user privileges.

ThoughtSpot cloud deployments allow you to collect security audit events and send them to your Security information and event management (SIEM) application in real-time.

These events can help your security operations personnel to detect potential security threats or compromised user accounts in your organization.

Permission: Requires administration privilege
