        id (string): The GUID of the connection
        configuration (string): A JSON object of the connection metadata. If
            this field is left empty, then the configuration saved in the
            connection is considered.   To get the tables based on a different
            configuration, include required attributes in the connection
            configuration JSON.   Example:       Get tables from Snowflake
            with a different user account than specified in the connection:
            {"user":"test_user","password":"test_pwd","role":"test_role"}

            the connection: {"database":"test_db"}
        include_column (bool): When set to true, the response will include
            column level details as well
