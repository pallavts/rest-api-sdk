ThoughtSpot REST API SDK
Repository for automatically generated REST API SDK projects. TypeScript is currently available, with more SDKs planned in the near future.

For Python, please see the library at https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python, which has implementations of V1 and V2.0 REST API and can be installed via pip from PyPi.

`api-spec` directory does has the current openapi specs for V2.0 REST API.
